# Controlling HBP Morphology Viewer from within a Jupyter notebook

To understand this tutorial, please read the <a href="markdown2html.php?exchangedata">data exchange tutorial</a> first.
That tutorial explains how to send data to HBP Morphology Viewer from within a web-application.
Jupyter notebooks do run inside a webbrowser, and it is only a small step to make the data exchange mechanism work for this use case.

Given that Jupyter notebooks are excellent tools for writing tutorials, we here refer to the tutorial notebook for further instructions. You can <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/neuroinformatics.nl/HBP/morphology-viewer/docs/movi-interface.ipynb">view (but not run) the notebook here</a>. 
To run and edit it, <a href="movi-interface.ipynb">download</a> the notebook and open it in your own private Jupyter notebook app, or in a public notebook server, such as <a href="https://notebooks.azure.com">Azure notebooks</a> or the <a href="https://collab.humanbrainproject.eu">HBP Collab</a>.
The notebook has issues on Google Colab notebooks because of additional security constraints implemented by Google.
